What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?
Computers don’t speak languages the way humans do. They communicate in machine code or machine language, while we speak English, Dutch, French or some other human language. Most of us don’t understand the millions of zeros and ones computers communicate in. And in turn, computers don’t understand human language unless they are programmed to do so. That’s where natural language processing (NLP) comes in.

Natural language processing is a form of artificial intelligence (AI) that gives computers the ability to read, understand and interpret human language. It helps computers measure sentiment and determine which parts of human language are important. For computers, this is an extremely difficult thing to do because of the large amount of unstructured data, the lack of formal rules and the absence of real-world context or intent.

In recent years, AI has evolved rapidly, and with that, NLP got more sophisticated, too. Many of us already use NLP daily without realizing it. You’ve probably used at least one of the following tools:

Spell checker.
Autocomplete.
Spam filters.
Voice text messaging
